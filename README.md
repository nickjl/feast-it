### `Prettier and eslint`

I havent had to set these up before for us so just followed from https://medium.com/dubizzletechblog/setting-up-prettier-and-eslint-for-js-and-react-apps-bbc779d29062

### `url-regex`

Decided to use a package to check the url to make it more reliable

### `Local storage`

I haven't really had to use local storage much, we primarily use redux to store all of our data so I'm sure there is probably a cleaner way of retrieving and updating the values - would look to handle the actual setting and getting all in one component.

### `Styled components`

I used styled components (this is what I currently use) to do some quick basic styling.

### `Form`

Would have liked to have done much more validation on this and more relevant errors, i.e. after initial error, revalidate on each key stroke rather than on submit, and to check errors of title and url simultaneously rather than one after the other.
